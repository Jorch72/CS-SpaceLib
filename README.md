# SpaceLib
Set of copy-paste library classes for Space Engineers Programmable Blocks

## How to use
Browse the files and copy/paste the contents into your scripts. Each script contains information about usage and possible dependencies.

Scripts can have a minified version; they should function exactly the same as the non-minified version, except they are smaller and (pretty much) unreadable. They lack documentation, so refer to the non-minified versions if you want to have more info or if you want to make modifications.

## Permissions
You can use these however you like, the license allows you.

Please be so kind to mention the github repository in your script (such as: ```/* Library classes from https://github.com/stanhebben/SpaceLib */```) so that your fellow coders know where to find updates, documentation and additional scripts.

## Contributing
Improvements are welcome, just submit a PR!

If you are working on new library classes and would like them added, feel free to open a ticket.

Features requests are possible too, but my spare time is limited, so your chances on me implementing it greatly depend on how fun I think the idea is.
